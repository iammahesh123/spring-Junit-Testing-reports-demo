# Spring JUnit Testing Reports Demo

This project demonstrates how to generate and use testing reports for Spring applications using JUnit.

## Overview

Testing is an integral part of software development, and generating testing reports can provide valuable insights into the quality and performance of the codebase. In this demo, we'll showcase how to configure and generate testing reports for Spring applications using JUnit.

## Features

- Configuration of JUnit testing framework for Spring applications
- Generation of testing reports using popular libraries such as JaCoCo and Surefire
- Integration with build tools like Maven for automated testing and reporting

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java`: Contains the Java source code for the Spring application.
- `src/test/java`: Contains the test cases written using JUnit.
- `pom.xml`: Maven project configuration file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iammahesh123/spring-Junit-Testing-reports-demo.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
 ```bash
  cd spring-Junit-Testing-reports-demo
 ```
3. Build the project using Maven:
 ```bash
mvn clean package
 ```
4. Run the application:
```bash
mvn test
 ```

5. Access the testing reports generated in the target/surefire-reports and target/site/jacoco directories.
## Configuration
- 'pom.xml': Contains Maven configurations for JUnit, JaCoCo, and Surefire plugins.
